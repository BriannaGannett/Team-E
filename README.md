### Tentative Mission/Problem Statement: As a team, we wish to work cohesively together to create a project that will fix a problem close to our hearts.

Human task games

1.) Some people have a difficult time staying motivated to do important tasks. for example: Getting groceries, doing laundry, cooking healthy meals.

2.) When people aren't motivated, they might put off important tedious tasks.

3.) Putting off important tasks can cause problems for people getting work done or making healthy decisions.

4.) Prior programs do not motivate users to do tasks. If there was a way to make people motivated to do these tasks by positively reinforcing the desired behavior, it could help them to complete their tasks.

How can we make a fun application that helps people stay motivated and track daily tasks?
