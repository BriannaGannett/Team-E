### Problem Statement: As a team, we wish to work cohesively together to create a project that will fix a problem close to our hearts.

Human task games

1.) Some people have a difficult time staying motivated to do important tasks. for example: Getting groceries, doing laundry, cooking healthy meals.

2.) When people aren't motivated, they might put off important tedious tasks causing tasks to build up and become overwhelming.

3.) Putting off important tasks can cause work to be done late and can further demotivate people which puts them in a negative headspace.

4.) Prior programs do not motivate users to do tasks. If there was a way to make people motivated to do these tasks by positively reinforcing the desired behavior and making the tasks feel like a game, it could help them to complete their tasks.

How can we make a game like web application that helps people stay motivated and turn their daily responsibilities into enjoyable challenges?
